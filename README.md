# hangman-game
This Python script is an implementation of the classic Hangman game. A random word is chosen from a predefined list, and the player must guess letters to uncover the word before running out of lives.

**How it Works?**
Initialization:
      • A word is randomly chosen from a list.
      • The number of lives is set to 6.
Game Loop:
      • The player guesses letters to uncover the word.
      • Correct guesses reveal the corresponding letters in the word.
      • Incorrect guesses result in a loss of life and progression through hangman stages.
      • The game continues until the player either guesses the word or runs out of lives.
End Game:
      • If the player guesses the word correctly, they win.
      • If the player runs out of lives, they lose.

      
  Enjoy playing Hangman and test your word-guessing skills!
